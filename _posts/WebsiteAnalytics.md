#Website Analytics

We are in the process of looking at our website through the lens of Google Analytics. The goal is to better understand our site visitors in a way that informs future updates to the site design and content. We have set a goal for 2016 to better understand the goals and behavior of visitors to our site in order to inform decisions about the future development of the site. 

##How does it help us identify the areas most used by visitors so that we prioritize those?

As of now, the most popular pages are: Careers, Individual Job Postings, "Leaders," Firm Profile, Offices/Locations, "Contact Us," then we start getting into Work. Even though an unequal share of time is spent on News, Projects, and Work>By Type and Work>By Service, the end-user is not getting to the things we hope to reveal on the site. People click on the Dubai office more often that they click on Healthcare.

##How does it clarify the top 10-20 things people do on our site and what we WANT them to be doing?

Obviously there is a disconnect - people do not visit Work as often as we would like. They almost never click on News, Publications or Research even though we update those often and they are important internally. 

##What are our current list of priorities with the website and does this data confirm that the usage would warrant those changes?

The current priorities with our programmers concern the China portal and integrating more video (homepage, elsewhere). We're also organizing internally to update the office location landing pages. News and project content is also a priority that gets added on an as-needed basis. There's a larger discussion that will need to determine how PYR, Portland, and Genesis get folded into our list of service offerings.  

The data right now confirms that a lot of this may be for naught. For instance, we don't have data on how many people are clicking on the main carousel images, which lead to news items. Other existing data we need to mine for might tell us if the 'portals' are a waste of time or not. 

If we prioritize what we want people to find on the site, we may reorganize what we ask of the programmers to perform/track on our behalf. 

We also need to put into the site some ability to track how often people click on things the VCard and MyBook. These also do track well. We also need to add the ability to track downloads. These we can only track now by the pages where the download link exists. 

##What is the experience of people accessing the site from multiple device types?

Preliminary investigation indicates that people exit our site more easily when looking at it from a mobile device (fewer pages viewed, shorter time spent looking at site). Website is not the most mobile-friendly.
